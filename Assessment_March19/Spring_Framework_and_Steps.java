//-----------------------------------------------------SPRING--------------------------------------------------------------------
//      Father of Spring framework - Rod Johnson
//		Light weight Open source Framework
//      Released in October 2002
//		Easily develop web applications
//		Spring Framework is based on the principles of -
//			1. dependency injection (DI) 2. inversion of control (IoC)
//      These principles reduce coupling between components and increase modularity and maintainability of applications.
//      We have two types of dependency injections - 
//			1. Setter Based 
//			2. Constructor Based
//		Spring Framework is a modular framework and consists of several modules.
//		Spring JDBC: This module provides support for JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) and simplifies database access using JDBC.
//		Spring ORM: This module provides integration with Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks such as Hibernate, JPA, and iBatis.
//		Spring Web: This module provides support for building web applications using Spring MVC (Model-View-Controller) and other web-related features such as RESTful services, WebSocket, and Servlets.
//		Spring Security: This module provides security features for Spring-based applications, including authentication, authorization, and access control.
//		Spring Integration: This module provides support for building message-driven architectures and integrating with other systems using messaging channels, endpoints, and adapters.
//		Spring Batch: This module provides support for batch processing and allows developers to build batch jobs that can handle large volumes of data.
//		Spring Data: This module provides integration with different data stores such as MongoDB, Cassandra, and Redis. It also provides a unified programming model for data access and simplifies working with data in Spring-based applications.

//		------------------------------------STEPS TO DEVELOP SPRING PROJECT--------------------------------------------------------------
//		1. Create Java Project 
//		2. Load the drivers 
//		3. Create bean class 
//		4. Create xml file to get the properties 
//		5. Create test class
		
//		Resource is AncestorEvent interfacEvent from org.springframework.com.io.Resource package
//		Resource represents the information of xml file
//		ClassPathResource is an implementation class of Resource Interface from org.springframework.core.io package
//		To return the bean, we have BeanFactory. BeanFactory is an interface which is from org.springframework.beans.factory
//		XmlBeanFactory is an implementation class of BeanFactory from org.springframework.beans.factory package
